# issuedashboard

It's a dashboard to keep a realtime tab on issues created by people that forked a selected repository. This can be used as a tool to help during code-review sessions we hold in class. 

## Objectives

As a teacher i want to be able to log in using my Github account. Select the repository that my students forked and see students issue shooting activity in a neutral way. (It's not a leaderboard!) Secondary objectives are the ability to decide whether comments have an interpretable title and an explanatory message and the ability to write comments on issues to make them better, preferably with standard 'hints'.

## Installation

You probably know the drill:

```
$> npm install
$> npm start
```

## Use


## Tech-stack

This app uses Node.js, dotenv, express, socket.io, @octokit/graphql

## Acknowledgments

This app was thought up during a code-review session with Lukas van Driel, Robin Frugte and myself.
